# Orakel Queue System Server

Backend application for the Orakel Queue System. The [client application](https://github.com/OrakelOsloMet/Orakel_Queue_Client) is hosted on [OrakelOslomet](https://github.com/OrakelOsloMet) GitHub Page as to avoid having the public-facing application hosted in my name.

A detailed description of the Server Application will come later...
